            <p>Have you ever wondered what the denizens of a realm think about a hero who exploits them for quests?
            <br>What about a hero who feels free to walk into any unlocked house and steal loot?
            <br>What about those pesky self-proclaimed "heroes" who cut plants and break pots without permission?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this game, those NPC opinions drive the gameplay. You play as a nobody, a character who follows in the 
                aftermath of a hero's quest. Along your journey through an infinite landscape, you encounter many situations
                which will test your politeness against the friendly and unfriendly entities alike. What kind of traveler 
                will you be?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Features:
                <br>An infinite, procedurally-generated overworld,
                with generated villages and dungeons.
                <br>NPC interactions will have an effect on future encounters.
                <br>A unique system that transitions between real-time overworld movement and turn-based combat, without a 'battle menu.'
                <br>Simple, single-button commands for equipping items. No complex inventory managing!
                <br>A health system that prioritizes maintaining armor integrity.
                <br><br>...And much more that's secret for now!
